# Duniter v2s

üÜô A rewriting of [Duniter v1](https://duniter.org) in the [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) framework.

‚ö†Ô∏è Duniter-v2s is under active development.

üöß A test network called "ƒûDev" is deployed, allowing to test wallets and indexers.

## Use

### Join ƒûDev network

The easiest way is to use the docker image.

Minimal command to deploy a temporary mirror peer:

```docker
docker run -it -p9944:9944 -e DUNITER_CHAIN_NAME=gdev duniter/duniter-v2s-gdev-800:latest
```

To go further, read [How to deploy a permanent mirror node on ƒûDev network üîó](https://duniter.org/wiki/duniter-v2/#run-a-mirror-node).

### Create your local blockchain

It can be useful to deploy your local blockchain, for instance to have a controlled environment to develop/test an application that interacts with the blockchain.

```docker
docker run -it -p9944:9944 duniter/duniter-v2s-gdev-800:latest
```

Or use the [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) at the root of this repository.

#### Control when your local blockchain should produce blocks

By default, your local blockchain produces a new block every 6 seconds, which is not practical in some cases.

You can decide when to produce blocks with the cli option `--sealing` which has two modes:

- `--sealing=instant`: produce a block immediately upon receiving a transaction into the transaction pool
- `--sealing=manual`: produce a block upon receiving an RPC request (method `engine_createBlock`).

### Shell autocompletion

See [autocompletion](./docs/user/autocompletion.md) to generate shell autocompletion for duniter commands.

## Contribute

If you are beginner in Rust and need a well guided tutorial, follow the [beginner walkthrough](./docs/dev/beginner-walkthrough.md).

Before any contribution, please read carefully the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file and our [git conventions](./docs/dev/git-conventions.md).

### Setup your dev environment

First, complete the [basic setup instructions](./docs/dev/setup.md).

### Build

NOTE: You must first follow the instructions in the [Setup](#setup-your-dev-environment) section.

Use the following command to build the node without launching it:

```sh
cargo build
```

### Run

Use Rust's native `cargo` command to build and launch the node:

```sh
cargo run -- --dev
```

This will deploy a local blockchain with test accounts (Alice, Bob, etc) in the genesis.
Open `https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944` to watch and interact with your node.

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/debug/duniter -lruntime=debug --dev
```
