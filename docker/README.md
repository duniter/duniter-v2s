# duniter/duniter-v2s

Duniter is the software that supports the [Äž1 libre-currency blockchain](https://duniter.org/).

[Duniter v2s](https://git.duniter.org/nodes/rust/duniter-v2s) is a compete rewrite of Duniter based on the Substrate / Polkadot framework. **This is alpha state work in progress.**

# Environment variables

* `DUNITER_NODE_NAME`
  The node name. Default: random name
* `DUNITER_CHAIN_NAME`
  The currency to process. Should be "gdev" at the current duniter-v2s development stage.
* `DUNITER_PUBLIC_ADDR`
  The libp2p public address base. See [libp2p documentation](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/addressing/). When this variable is not defined duniter-v2s guesses one from the node's IPv4 address.
  This variable is useful when the node is behind a reverse-proxy with its ports not directly exposed.
  Note: the `p2p/<peer_id>` part of the address shouldn't be set in this variable. It is automatically added by Duniter.
* `DUNITER_LISTEN_ADDR`
  The libp2p listen address. See [libp2p documentation](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/addressing/). This variable is useful when running a validator node behind a reverse proxy, to force the P2P end point in websocket mode with:
  `DUNITER_LISTEN_ADDR=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30333/ws`
* `DUNITER_RPC_CORS`
  Value of the polkadot `--rpc-cors` option. Defaults to `all`.
* `DUNITER_VALIDATOR`
  Boolean (`true` / `false`) to run the node in validator mode. Defaults to `false`.
  Configure the polkadot options `--validator --rpc-methods Unsafe`.
* `DUNITER_DISABLE_PROMETHEUS`
  Boolean to disable the telemetry entry point. Defaults to false.
