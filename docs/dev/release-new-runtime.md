# Release a new Runtime

![](img/release-pipeline.png)

> The following instructions have been described in french at: [Cr√©er une release](https://forum.duniter.org/t/industrialiser-le-demarrage-dune-nouvelle-gx/11535/41).

## Process

Example for `runtime-800`.

### New release with new Runtime

* create a `release/runtime-800` branch locally
* update the values:
  * update spec version (in `runtime/<currency>/src/lib.rs`)
  * eventually update `gdev.yml` (smiths, tech. committee, ...)
* push the `release/runtime-800` branch
  * in the CI/CD, wait for `Create release` button to be available and click on it (see above screenshot)

The Runtime is now available on the release page [runtime-800](https://git.duniter.org/nodes/rust/duniter-v2s/-/releases/runtime-800).

### New Client

The Client is published as a Docker image.

You may want to publish a new Client version along with a Runtime update.

#### New raw specs (optional)

For a reboot, you will likely want to update the raw specs:

* in the CI/CD, wait for `release_gdev_specs` button to be available and click on it
* in the CI/CD, wait for `release_gtest_specs` button to be available and click on it
* wait for both jobs to finish
* update the Client raw specs with `cargo xtask update-raw-specs runtime-800`

#### New version (mandatory)

Update Client values:

* update Client version (in `Cargo.toml`)
* update `Cargo.lock` with `cargo build`
  
#### Publish Docker image

Commit everything and push the branch:

* in the CI/CD, a new pipeline has been launched
* you can stop jobs `create_g1_data`, `gdev_srtool`, `gtest_srtool` (won't be used)
* click on `gdev_docker_deploy` and `gtest_docker_deploy`

The Docker images should now be available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/duniter/duniter-v2s-gdev/tags.

## Runtime tag and spec version

Our runtime tags use `xxyy` version numbers where `x` corresponds to major change and `y` hotfix.

Make sure to move any issue or merge request assigned to the choosen milestone `runtime-xxyy` to the next one. This prevents from forgetting unfinished work.
